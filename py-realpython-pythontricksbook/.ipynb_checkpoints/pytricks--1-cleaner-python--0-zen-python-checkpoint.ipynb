    "* Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
    "* Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "* Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "* Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "* Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "* Sparse is better than dense.\n",
    "* Readability counts.\n",
    "* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "* Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "* Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "* Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "* In the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "* There should be one -and preferably only one- obvious way to do it.\n",
    "* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "* Now is better than never.\n",
    "* Although never is often better than _right_ now\n",
    "* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
    "* Namespaces are one honking great idea -let's do more of those!"
