Without structure, you might get a shopping list that says \"some chicken\" instead of \"2 lbs chicken breast\" - not very helpful when you're at the store!\n","\n","To do that, we are going to use **Pydantic**, which acts like a strict organizer for our data.

For example, if we define a `GroceryItem` model with `name: str` and `estimated_price: str`, it ensures that every grocery item must have both a name and a price estimate. `Field` adds extra rules and descriptions, like explaining that `quantity` should be formatted as \"2 lbs\" or \"1 gallon\". `List` from `typing` allows complex data structures, like a `ShoppingCategory` model storing `items: List[GroceryItem]` - a produce section containing multiple vegetables.\n","\n","This makes handling grocery data simple and reliable, ensuring that when our AI agent says \"buy chicken,\" it specifically means \"buy 2 lbs of chicken breast for $8-12 from the meat section.\" ([Pydantic Docs](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"13250e87-e388-4cd1-8cc4-9b1168b991de","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Our Grocery Shopping Data Structure\n","\n","1. ```GroceryItem```         → Individual grocery item with details\n","2. ```MealPlan```           → Recipe information with researched ingredients  \n","3. ```ShoppingCategory```   → Store section with organized items\n","4. ```GroceryShoppingPlan``` → Complete shopping strategy with budget analysis\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0e3e7236-ba30-4b34-b42b-284cf8eb37da","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### **`GroceryItem`** \n","\n","Think of this as designing the shopping list template before going to the store.
